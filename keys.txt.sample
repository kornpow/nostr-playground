# Sample private key file for Nostr Playground
# 
# This file should contain your private key in hex format.
# The private key should be 64 characters long (32 bytes).
# 
# IMPORTANT: Keep this file secure and never share your private key!
# 
# Example format (replace with your actual private key):
# 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
# 
# To generate a new key pair, run:
# uv run like_post.py <any_event_id> --keys keys.txt
# 
# This will automatically generate a new key pair and save it to keys.txt
# 
# Your public key will be displayed when you first run the script.
# You can share your public key with others, but keep the private key secret.
# 
# Replace this line with your actual private key:
